# Model Loading Connection Reset - Debugging Plan

## 1. SPECIFICATION

### Problem Statement
The multi-model translation service experiences connection resets during model loading:
- Connections are aborted with `ConnectionResetError(104, 'Connection reset by peer')`
- Service initially reports healthy with 1 model loaded, then fails
- Issue affects both NLLB and Aya model loading
- Tests timeout waiting for models to become ready

### Observed Symptoms
1. Service starts successfully and reports healthy status
2. Initial health check shows `models_loaded: 1`
3. Subsequent health checks fail with connection errors
4. Model loading appears to crash the server process
5. No models are accessible via `/models` endpoint (503 error)

### Requirements for Resolution
1. Identify root cause of connection resets during model loading
2. Ensure models load successfully without crashing the service
3. Maintain stable connections during resource-intensive operations
4. Provide clear error messages for debugging
5. Implement recovery mechanisms if needed

### Success Criteria
- Models load successfully within expected timeframes
- Service remains responsive during model loading
- Health checks continue working throughout loading process
- Tests pass without connection errors
- Clear logging of any issues encountered

## 2. PSEUDOCODE

### Debugging Approach
```
function debug_model_loading_issue():
    # Step 1: Verify environment
    check_python_package_versions()
    verify_cuda_availability()
    check_system_resources()
    
    # Step 2: Create minimal reproduction
    test_direct_model_loading()
    test_service_without_models()
    test_incremental_model_loading()
    
    # Step 3: Enhanced logging
    add_exception_tracking()
    add_memory_monitoring()
    add_process_monitoring()
    
    # Step 4: Test different configurations
    test_cpu_only_loading()
    test_reduced_batch_size()
    test_different_model_versions()
    
    # Step 5: Implement fixes
    fix_package_compatibility()
    add_error_recovery()
    optimize_memory_usage()
```

## 3. ARCHITECTURE

### Debugging Components

#### A. Environment Analyzer
```python
class EnvironmentAnalyzer:
    """Analyze system environment for compatibility issues"""
    
    def check_package_versions(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Check all relevant package versions"""
        
    def verify_cuda_setup(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Verify CUDA/GPU configuration"""
        
    def analyze_system_resources(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Check available memory, CPU, disk space"""
```

#### B. Minimal Reproduction Test
```python
class MinimalReproductionTest:
    """Create minimal test case to reproduce issue"""
    
    def test_direct_import(self) -> bool:
        """Test importing models directly"""
        
    def test_basic_service(self) -> bool:
        """Test service without model loading"""
        
    def test_single_model(self) -> bool:
        """Test loading one model at a time"""
```

#### C. Enhanced Server Monitoring
```python
class ServerMonitor:
    """Monitor server process during model loading"""
    
    def track_memory_usage(self):
        """Monitor memory consumption"""
        
    def track_process_health(self):
        """Monitor process status and errors"""
        
    def capture_crash_logs(self):
        """Capture any crash information"""
```

### Component Interaction Flow
```
1. Environment Analyzer → Identifies potential issues
2. Minimal Reproduction → Isolates the problem
3. Server Monitor → Captures failure details
4. Fix Implementation → Resolves identified issues
5. Verification Tests → Confirms resolution
```

## 4. REFINEMENT

### Phase 1: Immediate Investigation (Day 1)

#### Task 1.1: Package Compatibility Check
