# SPARC Specification: Adaptive Translation Chunking System

**Project**: Telegram NLLB Translation Enhancement  
**Component**: Adaptive Translation Chunking  
**SPARC Phase**: 1 - Specification  
**Date**: May 2025

## Project Goals

Create an intelligent translation chunking system that automatically optimizes text segmentation to maximize translation quality while maintaining acceptable performance and cost efficiency.

## Target Audience

- **Primary**: Telegram Web users translating complex emotional/personal messages
- **Secondary**: Users translating technical documentation, long-form content
- **Tertiary**: Developers integrating translation APIs

## Problem Definition

### Current State Issues
1. **Quality Degradation**: Long text (>1000 chars) produces garbled, incomplete translations
2. **Context Loss**: Fixed chunking breaks semantic meaning across boundaries  
3. **No Adaptation**: System cannot learn optimal chunk sizes for different content types
4. **Poor UX**: Users receive low-quality translations with no recourse

### Evidence from Testing
- 2000+ character Russian emotional text → severely degraded English output
- 200-300 character chunks → natural, accurate translations
- Quality varies dramatically by content type and language pair

## Functional Requirements

- **FR-1.4**: Support all language pairs in current system

### FR-2: Quality Assessment System
- **FR-2.1**: Evaluate translation quality using multiple metrics
- **FR-2.2**: Detect quality degradation indicators automatically
- **FR-2.3**: Provide quality scoring from 0.0-1.0
- **FR-2.4**: Support model confidence integration when available

### FR-3: Adaptive Optimization
- **FR-3.1**: Automatically find optimal chunk sizes for poor-quality translations
- **FR-3.2**: Use binary search algorithm for efficient optimization

### NFR-5: Cost Efficiency
- **NFR-5.1**: <15% increase in API costs overall
- **NFR-5.2**: Optimization triggered for <10% of translations
- **NFR-5.3**: Cache utilization to minimize redundant API calls
- **NFR-5.4**: Cost transparency and user control

## Technical Constraints

### TC-1: Existing Infrastructure
- Must integrate with current FastAPI server architecture
- Must work with existing NLLB/Aya translation models
- Must maintain compatibility with current userscript
- Must use existing authentication and rate limiting

### TC-2: API Limitations
- Translation API rate limits (per-minute request caps)
- Model-specific input length restrictions
- Confidence scores may not be available for all models
- Network latency for multiple API calls

### TC-3: Client-Side Constraints
- Browser localStorage limitations for caching
- JavaScript execution time limits
- Memory constraints for large text processing
- Cross-origin request restrictions

### TC-4: Language Support
- Must support all existing language pairs
- Handle RTL languages appropriately
- Respect language-specific punctuation and segmentation rules
- Account for different text expansion ratios between languages

## User Scenarios

### US-1: Emotional Message Translation (Primary)
**Actor**: User receiving complex emotional message in Russian  
**Goal**: Get accurate, nuanced English translation preserving emotional tone  
**Scenario**:
1. User encounters 1500-character Russian message in Telegram
2. Clicks translate button
3. System provides immediate semantic-chunked translation (2s)
4. System detects quality issues, shows "Improving translation..."
5. System optimizes chunking, provides enhanced translation (3s additional)
6. User reads natural, emotionally accurate English text

**Success Criteria**: Translation preserves emotional nuance and relationship context
