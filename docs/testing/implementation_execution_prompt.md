# AI Architect Prompt: NLLB API Test Implementation Execution Plan

## Context

You are an AI Architect responsible for implementing a comprehensive API test suite for the NLLB (No Language Left Behind) Translation System. The test architecture has been designed and documented in `api_test_architecture.md`. Your task is to create a detailed, step-by-step implementation plan with ranked priorities and specific execution tasks.

## Your Mission

Transform the architectural design into actionable implementation tasks that will achieve 95% server code coverage while addressing all identified test gaps. You must prioritize tasks based on impact, dependencies, and risk mitigation.

## Current System State

### Existing Codebase Structure
```
server/
├── app/
│   ├── main.py                    # FastAPI application with /health and /translate endpoints
│   └── utils/
│       ├── model_loader.py        # NLLB model loading and translation logic
│       └── language_detection.py  # Russian/English language detection
├── tests/
│   ├── conftest.py               # Basic fixtures and mocks
│   ├── integration/
│   │   └── test_api_endpoints.py # Existing API endpoint tests
│   └── unit/
│       ├── test_language_detection.py
│       └── test_model_loader.py
├── pytest.ini                   # Basic pytest configuration
└── requirements-dev.txt         # Development dependencies
```

### Identified Test Gaps
1. **Rate Limiting**: Async behavior not properly mocked
2. **Translation Format**: Missing "Translated: " prefix consistency validation
3. **API Key Validation**: Incomplete edge case coverage
4. **Model Loading**: Startup event testing needs enhancement
5. **Error Scenarios**: Insufficient coverage of failure paths
6. **Performance Testing**: No load testing implementation
7. **Concurrent Testing**: Missing race condition coverage

### Current Coverage Status
- **Current Coverage**: ~75% (estimated from existing tests)
- **Target Coverage**: 95%
- **Coverage Gaps**: Error handling, edge cases, async behavior

## Required Deliverables

Create a comprehensive implementation execution plan that includes:

### 1. Task Prioritization Matrix
Rank all implementation tasks using this priority framework:
- **Priority 1 (Critical)**: Fixes existing test failures, addresses immediate gaps
- **Priority 2 (High)**: Implements core missing functionality
- **Priority 3 (Medium)**: Enhances test coverage and robustness  
- **Priority 4 (Low)**: Performance optimization and advanced features

### 2. Detailed Task Breakdown
For each task, provide:
- **Task ID**: Unique identifier (e.g., T001, T002)
- **Task Name**: Clear, actionable title
- **Description**: Specific implementation requirements
- **Dependencies**: Prerequisites and task relationships
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Measurable completion conditions
- **Estimated Effort**: Time complexity (S/M/L/XL)
- **Risk Level**: Implementation risk assessment
- **Files to Modify/Create**: Specific file paths and changes

### 3. Implementation Phases
Organize tasks into logical implementation phases:
- **Phase 1**: Foundation and Critical Fixes
- **Phase 2**: Core Test Implementation
- **Phase 3**: Advanced Testing and Edge Cases
- **Phase 4**: Performance and Optimization

### 4. Technical Implementation Specifications

#### Mock Implementation Strategy
Provide detailed specifications for:
- Enhanced `conftest.py` fixture improvements
- New mock classes for NLLB components
- Rate limiting mock implementation
- Async testing utilities

#### Test File Structure
Define exact test file organization:
```
tests/
├── conftest.py                    # Enhanced fixtures
├── unit/
│   ├── test_language_detection.py (enhanced)
│   ├── test_model_loader.py (enhanced)
│   └── test_request_models.py (new)
├── integration/
│   ├── test_api_endpoints.py (enhanced)
│   ├── test_authentication.py (new)
│   ├── test_rate_limiting.py (new)
│   └── test_error_handling.py (new)
└── performance/
    ├── test_load_testing.py (new)
    └── test_memory_usage.py (new)
```

#### Test Case Specifications
For each test category, specify:
- Exact test function names and signatures
- Mock setup requirements
- Assertion validation criteria
- Error condition testing scenarios

### 5. Quality Assurance Strategy

#### Coverage Validation
- Coverage measurement approach
- Coverage gap identification process
- Coverage improvement targets per phase

#### Test Execution Strategy
- CI/CD integration requirements
- Test execution order and dependencies
- Performance benchmarking approach

## Implementation Constraints and Requirements

### Technical Constraints

## Output Format

Structure your response as a comprehensive implementation guide with:

1. **Executive Summary** (2-3 paragraphs)
2. **Task Prioritization Matrix** (table format)
3. **Detailed Task Breakdown** (structured list)
4. **Implementation Phases** (timeline with milestones)
5. **Technical Specifications** (code examples and configurations)
6. **Quality Assurance Plan** (testing and validation approach)
7. **Risk Management Strategy** (identified risks and mitigations)
8. **Success Validation Framework** (metrics and checkpoints)

## Implementation Philosophy

Apply these principles throughout your planning:
- **Incremental Progress**: Each task should provide measurable value
- **Risk Mitigation**: Address high-risk items early
- **Maintainability**: Design for long-term test suite evolution
- **Practical Excellence**: Balance perfection with practical delivery
- **Continuous Validation**: Build in regular checkpoints and validation

Your implementation plan will serve as the definitive guide for executing the API test architecture design. Be specific, actionable, and comprehensive in your task breakdown while maintaining focus on the core objective of achieving robust, maintainable 95% test coverage.
