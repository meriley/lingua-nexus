# AI Testing Architect Prompt: End-to-End Test Architecture Design

## Mission Statement
You are an expert AI Testing Architect tasked with designing a comprehensive End-to-End (E2E) testing strategy for the NLLB Translation System. Your goal is to create a detailed E2E test plan that validates the complete system behavior when running as a live HTTP service, complementing the existing comprehensive test suite.

## Context and Current State

### Existing Test Infrastructure
The project already has a robust testing foundation:
- **Unit Tests**: Core logic validation with extensive mocking
- **Integration Tests**: FastAPI TestClient-based testing (32+ test files)
- **Performance Tests**: Load testing, memory monitoring, concurrent request handling
- **Security Tests**: Injection prevention, authentication, input validation
- **CI/CD Tests**: GitHub Actions pipeline with automated testing
- **Maintenance Tests**: Test health monitoring and cleanup automation

### What's Missing: True E2E Validation
Current integration tests use FastAPI's TestClient (in-process testing). We need true E2E tests that:
1. Start the actual FastAPI service as a separate process
2. Make real HTTP requests over the network
3. Validate complete request/response lifecycle
4. Test service deployment scenarios
5. Verify real-world network behavior and edge cases

## System Under Test: NLLB Translation API

### Service Architecture
- **Framework**: FastAPI with Uvicorn ASGI server
- **Model**: NLLB-200 (No Language Left Behind) translation model
- **Authentication**: API key-based (X-API-Key header)
- **Rate Limiting**: SlowAPI with 10 requests/minute per client
- **Endpoints**:
  - `GET /health` - Health check endpoint
  - `POST /translate` - Translation endpoint
- **Deployment**: Docker containerized, environment-configurable

### Service Configuration
```bash
# Environment Variables
API_KEY=test_api_key
MODEL_NAME=facebook/nllb-200-distilled-600M
DEVICE=cpu
LOG_LEVEL=INFO

# Default Port: 8000
# Default Host: 0.0.0.0
```

## E2E Test Architecture Requirements

### 1. Service Lifecycle Management
Design tests that handle:
- **Service Startup**: Launching the FastAPI service with proper configuration
- **Health Verification**: Ensuring service is ready before running tests
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Properly terminating the service after tests
- **Port Management**: Dynamic port allocation to avoid conflicts
- **Process Isolation**: Running tests independently without interference

### 2. Real Network Testing Scenarios
Create tests for:
- **HTTP Protocol Compliance**: Proper headers, status codes, content types
- **Network Timeouts**: Connection timeouts, request timeouts, keep-alive behavior
- **Connection Handling**: Concurrent connections, connection pooling
- **Payload Sizes**: Large request/response handling over real HTTP
- **Network Errors**: Connection refused, network unreachable, DNS failures

### 3. Deployment Environment Validation
Test scenarios including:
- **Docker Container Testing**: Service running in containerized environment
- **Environment Variable Handling**: Configuration through environment variables
- **Port Binding**: Service accessibility on configured ports
- **Volume Mounting**: Persistent storage and configuration files
- **Resource Constraints**: Memory limits, CPU constraints in containers

### 4. End-to-End User Journeys
Design complete user workflow tests:
- **New User Onboarding**: First-time API usage with authentication
- **Typical Usage Patterns**: Common translation workflows
- **Error Recovery**: How users handle and recover from errors
- **Rate Limiting Experience**: User behavior when hitting rate limits
- **Long-running Sessions**: Extended usage patterns and session management

### 5. Production-Like Scenarios
Include realistic production conditions:
- **Load Balancer Behavior**: Multiple service instances (if applicable)
- **Reverse Proxy Testing**: Nginx/Apache front-end scenarios
- **SSL/TLS Termination**: HTTPS endpoint testing
- **Monitoring Integration**: Health check endpoints for monitoring systems
- **Log Analysis**: Structured logging and log aggregation testing

#### Service Management Infrastructure
```python
# Example service manager interface
class E2EServiceManager:
    def start_service(self, config: dict) -> ServiceInstance
    def wait_for_readiness(self, timeout: int = 30) -> bool
    def stop_service(self, graceful: bool = True) -> None
    def get_service_url(self) -> str
    def get_service_logs(self) -> List[str]
```
