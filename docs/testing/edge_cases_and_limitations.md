# Edge Cases and Testing Limitations

This document outlines edge cases and testing limitations for the NLLB Translation System.

## Server Component

### Language Detection
- **Mixed-Language Content**: The current language detection algorithm uses a simple heuristic based on character frequency. This approach has limitations with mixed-language content.
  - Limited to Russian/English detection only
  - May not correctly identify predominantly Russian text with significant Latin characters
  - Does not handle other languages or scripts
  
### API Endpoints
- **Rate Limiting Testing**: Due to the nature of rate limiting, tests must use mocks to simulate reaching limits rather than actually making enough requests to hit limits.
  - Production behavior may differ depending on distributed deployment
  - Concurrent access patterns not fully testable in unit tests

### Model Loading
- **Model Size and Dependencies**: The full NLLB model is large and resource-intensive.
  - Tests use mocked models to avoid requiring full model downloads
  - Memory usage tests rely on mocks rather than actual memory consumption
  - CUDA-specific behavior is mocked and not tested on actual GPU hardware

### Translation Quality
- **Translation Quality**: The tests verify translation functionality but not quality.
  - Translation accuracy cannot be automatically tested
  - Tests do not validate performance across all possible language pairs
  - Edge cases like extremely long sentences, rare vocabulary, or specialized terminology not tested

## Testing Gaps and Limitations

1. **Concurrent Request Handling**: Tests do not thoroughly validate behavior under high load with many concurrent requests.

2. **Integration with External Services**: Integration with monitoring, logging, or cloud infrastructure not fully tested.

3. **Long-running Stability**: Tests do not cover behavior over extended periods of operation.

4. **Security Testing**: Limited testing of security aspects beyond basic authentication.

5. **Dependency Version Compatibility**: Tests do not cover compatibility across different versions of dependencies.

6. **Error Reporting**: Tests cover error cases but not the quality or usability of error messages.

7. **Performance Testing**: Lack of comprehensive performance benchmarks to evaluate system performance.

## Recommended Manual Testing

Some aspects of the system require manual testing:

1. Translation quality assessment with real-world content
2. User experience evaluation
3. Performance under load with real model and hardware
4. Cross-browser compatibility for userscript component
5. AutoHotkey component functionality on Windows systems

## Future Test Improvements

1. Integration with a proper language detection library
2. More comprehensive language pair testing
3. Performance benchmark suite
4. Extended coverage of error conditions and recovery
5. Cross-component integration testing
