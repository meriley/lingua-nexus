# NLLB Translation System Test Issues Summary

## Current Status

We've made significant progress in fixing test issues, but there are still some failures to address. Here's a summary of the current state:

### Fixes Completed:
1. Server Component:
   - Fixed rate limiting test by properly mocking the rate limiter handler
   - Fixed authorization in the API key fixture
   - Improved error handling to better handle edge cases
   - Added additional test coverage for specific error scenarios

2. UserScript Component:
   - Fixed DOM manipulation in the addTranslateButton function
   - Improved text content replacement to properly handle original text
   - Enhanced error handling for failed translations
   - Fixed integration test setup to avoid module import errors
   - Increased timeouts for async operations

3. Documentation:
   - Created comprehensive NLLB model requirements documentation

### Remaining Issues:

1. Server Component:
   - Translation response format in tests doesn't match mock implementation
   - Several API endpoint tests are still failing due to assertion errors
   - Some rate limiter tests are showing warnings about unawaited coroutines

2. UserScript Component:
   - Test coverage thresholds not met (only 58.38% statement coverage vs 90% target)
   - Several functions and branches still need test coverage

## Next Steps to Resolve Remaining Issues

### Server Component:
1. Update translation mock in `conftest.py` to ensure it returns responses in the expected format
2. Fix the `test_translation_endpoint_full_coverage` test to properly verify translations
3. Ensure `test_startup_event` can properly load the model in the test environment
4. Fix the coroutine warning in the rate limiting test by properly awaiting the mock function

### UserScript Component:
1. Add more unit tests to increase test coverage:
   - Tests for the `translateMessage` function
   - Tests for error handling in the translation process
   - Tests for various settings and configuration options
2. Consider adjusting coverage thresholds or marking certain parts of the code as excluded from coverage

### General:
1. Create a more comprehensive test plan document
2. Set up proper integration testing with Playwright
3. Consider implementing proper mocking for external dependencies

## Progress on Original Requirements

1. Server rate limiting test in test_api_endpoints.py: ✅ Fixed
2. Status code mismatch in translation_endpoint_full_coverage: ✅ Fixed
3. Error handling in app/main.py: ✅ Added
4. DOM manipulation in addTranslateButton function: ✅ Fixed
5. Translation function to properly replace content: ✅ Fixed
6. Error handling for failed translations: ✅ Implemented
7. Timeouts for async operations: ✅ Increased
8. NLLB model requirements: ✅ Documented

## Coverage Status

### Server Component:
- Current: 93% (98 statements, 7 missed)
- Target: 95%
- Gap: 2%

### UserScript Component:
- Current: 58.38% (statements), 43.13% (branches), 63.63% (functions)
- Target: 90% (statements), 80% (branches), 85% (functions)
- Gap: ~32% (statements), ~37% (branches), ~21% (functions)

These gaps will need to be addressed with additional test coverage in a future update.
